# Healthcare KPI Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing healthcare Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Lowell General Hospital to assess performance and identify potential areas for improvement. The analysis focuses on three primary KPIs:
1. **Average Licensed Bed Occupancy Rate**
2. **Unassisted Fall Rate per 1,000 Patient Days**
3. **Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score**

The results were visualized using Power BI to provide meaningful insights and recommendations for the hospital's leadership team.

## Key Features
- **Gauge Chart for Benchmark Analysis**: A gauge chart compares the hospital's average Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score (63) against the industry benchmark (65), highlighting a slight performance gap.
- **Heatmap for Occupancy Trends**: A heatmap visualizes monthly occupancy trends, revealing peak and low periods to help identify seasonal variations.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Scatter plots show relationships between KPIs, such as the impact of occupancy rates on fall rates or staff responsiveness.
- **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations are based on trends and gaps identified, aimed at improving patient satisfaction and reducing unassisted falls.
## Insights and Recommendations
1. **Staff Responsiveness Gap**:
   - The average Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score (63) is below the benchmark (65).
   - Recommendation: Implement staff training and improve response systems to bridge this gap.
   
2. **Occupancy Trends**:
   - Peak occupancy correlates with higher unassisted fall rates.
   - Recommendation: Allocate additional staff during high-occupancy periods to reduce fall risks.

3. **Seasonal Variations**:
   - Heatmap analysis shows fluctuations in occupancy and fall rates throughout the year.
   - Recommendation: Plan resources and training based on seasonal demand.
